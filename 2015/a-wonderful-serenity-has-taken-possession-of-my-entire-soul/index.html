                A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I
                enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
                for the bliss of souls like mine.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
                neglect my talents.
            </p>
            <p>
                I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was
                a greater artist than now.
            </p>
            <p>
                When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper
                surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner
                sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the
                earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little world among the
                stalks, and grow familiar with the countless indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel
                the presence of the Almighty, who formed us in his own image, and the breath of that universal love
                which bears and sustains us, as it floats around us in an eternity of bliss; and then, my friend, when
                darkness overspreads my eyes, and heaven and earth seem to dwell in my soul and absorb its power, like
                the form of a beloved mistress, then I often think with longing, Oh, would I could describe these
                conceptions, could impress upon paper all that is living so full and warm within me, that it might be
                the mirror of my soul, as my soul is the mirror of the infinite God!
            </p>
            <p>
                O my friend – but it is too much for my strength – I sink under the weight of the splendour of these
                visions!
            </p>
